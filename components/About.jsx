          <p>
            As a business analyst, I have always been passionate about being the communicational bridge between people. 
            I have a strong foundation in the broad aspects on computer science, with a focus on web
            technologies, cyber security and large data. I especially enjoy working in multi-disciplinary teams as I get really energized from working with skilled enthusiastic people. 
          </p>
          <p>Throughout my (relatively short) career, I have worked on a various projects, from simple static websites to
            complex enterprise-level e-commerce applications. I am always eager
            to learn and explore new technologies, and I am constantly seeking out opportunities to improve
            my skills and knowledge.</p>

            <p>In my free time I enjoy making music üé∏, working out ‚öΩ or hanging with my friends üç∫.</p>
